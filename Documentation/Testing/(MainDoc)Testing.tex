	\section{Introduction}
	Software testing is performed to verify that the completed software package functions according to the expectations defined by our requirements/specifications.\newline
	EVoting consists of different components, each designed to do a specific seperate task. It is important to test each component individually to insure that they do what is expected from them before building the project as a whole and executing it. Tests are therefore essential to our system to prevent bugs, compile time and run time errors.
	
	\subsection{Purpose}
	EVoting is an electronic voting system, designed specifically for government elections, but it can also be used in other scenarios where reliable electronic voting is needed. Since it is crutial that the voting procesess cannot be tampered with in any way, both reliability and security is of main importance. It is there extremely important to test the crutial parts of the system to ensure the system executes as expected and eliminate unexpected security and reliability threats.
	\subsection{Scope}
	The scope of this document is structured as follows:\newline
	In this document, we elaborate on the purpose as well as the specific details to why we are testing certain funtionality. The functionality that are considered for
	testing are listed in \autoref{sec:FunctionalFeaturesToBeTested}. Tests that have been identied from the requirements are discussed in detail in section TODO Furthermore, this document outlines the test environment and the risks involved in the testing approaches that will be followed. Assumptions and
	dependencies of this test plan will also be mentioned. \Cref{sec:DetailedTestResults} outlines, discusses and concludes on the results of the tests.
