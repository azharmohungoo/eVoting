This section will give a brief overview and description of the technologies that will be implemented in the system to achieve the desired outcome and allow not only successful completion of the project but doing it in the most effective and efficient manner.

	\begin{enumerate}		
		\item \textbf{PostgreSQL:}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[] PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards-compliance. As a database server, its primary function is to store data securely, supporting best practices, and to allow for retrieval at the request of other software applications. 
		\end{enumerate} 
		
		\item \textbf{Maven:}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[] Maven is a project management tool, which provides developers with a complete build lifecycle framework. Development teams can automate the project's build infrastructure in almost no time as Maven uses a standard directory layout and a default build lifecycle.
						
			What this means is that the process for building and distributing a particular artifact (project) is clearly defined; it is only necessary to learn a small set of commands to build any Maven project, and the POM will ensure they get the results they desired.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\newpage
		
		\item \textbf{Blockchain:}	
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[] MultiChain is a free software which people can download and run to design, deploy, and operate distributed ledgers (blockchains) that track ownership of digital tokens or assets.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item \textbf{Bower:}	
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[] Keeping track of all these packages and making sure they are up to date (or set to the specific versions you need) is tricky. It manages components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts or even image files. Bower doesnâ€™t concatenate or "minify" code or do anything else - it just installs the right versions of the packages you need and their dependencies. It's optimized for the front-end. If multiple packages depend on a package - jQuery for example - Bower will download jQuery just once. This is known as a flat dependency graph and it helps reduce page load.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item \textbf{Grunt:}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[] A task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects. Here's the idea: when working on a JavaScript project, there are a bunch of things you'll want to do regularly. Like what, you ask? Well, like concatenating given files, running JSHint on your code, running tests, or minifying your scripts.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item \textbf{Npm:}	
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[] A NodeJS package manager. As its name would imply, you can use it to install node programs. Also, if you use it in development, it makes it easier to specify and link dependencies.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item \textbf{Cordova:}	
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[] Formerly called as Phone Gap is a platform to build Native Mobile Applications using HTML5, CSS and Java Script.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item \textbf{LiquiBase:}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[] An open source database-independent library for tracking, managing and applying database schema changes. It was started in 2006 to allow easier tracking of database changes, especially in an agile software development environment.
