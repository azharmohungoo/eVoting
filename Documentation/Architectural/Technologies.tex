This section will give a brief overview and description of the technologies that will be implemented in the system to achieve the desired outcome and allow not only successful completion of the project but doing it in the most effective and efficient manner.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Ionic:} 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[] Ionic (mobile app framework) provides tools for developing hybrid mobile apps using web technologies such as HTML5 and CSS. It is an open-source framework, which helps to build hybrid apps using HTML5, and makes use of AngularJS. 
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item \textbf{PostgreSQL:}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[] PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards-compliance. As a database server, its primary function is to store data securely, supporting best practices, and to allow for retrieval at the request of other software applications. 
		\end{enumerate} 
		
		\item \textbf{Maven:}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[] Maven is a project management tool, which provides developers with a complete build lifecycle framework. Development teams can automate the project's build infrastructure in almost no time as Maven uses a standard directory layout and a default build lifecycle.
						
			What this means is that the process for building and distributing a particular artifact (project) is clearly defined; it is only necessary to learn a small set of commands to build any Maven project, and the POM will ensure they get the results they desired.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item \textbf{Blockchain:}	
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[] MultiChain is a free software which people can download and run to design, deploy, and operate distributed ledgers (blockchains) that track ownership of digital tokens or assets.
		\end{enumerate}
