What is intended for this project is to create a web and mobile platform, which can be used to cast votes in the provincial and national elections of South Africa. The following are benefits of the system:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The use of the Blockchain will allow for a transparent election process while still maintaining anonymity of the voters. 
		\item Votes that get lost or disregarded be it on purpose or not.
		\item Incorrect counting.
		\item Manual vote counting will no longer be required
		\item Remote casting of votes from a users preferred web browser or mobile smartphone. 
		\item Secure voting
		\item Prevent invalid votes from being cast through robust validation with each request.
	\end{enumerate}
