Elections are always a time where emotions are at a high and passion for a leader has never been greater. Sometimes this emotion and passion for a leader can lead to unlawful activities to get their chosen leader to to win the elections. By moving the system to an electronic environment it removes almost, if not all, these possibilities for unlawful activities to take place by using computers instead of humans. Although with the use of the Blockchain implementation, these activities can be suppressed.
	
Additionally to a secure and safe voting environment that allows ease of access from the voter's mobile or web browser, it will also make the voting process more efficient, with shorter queues to cast a vote and the progress of elections and the final result will be presented more rapidly, with periodic updates as the system analyses these votes. This system can be used in multiple scenarios not only in election. 

A more generic version of the electronic voting system can be implemented to allow users to partake in surveys, where instead of an election poll, users can create their own custom polls in which they can control participation. A further instance would be using such a system for national wide statistics, gathered by completing a poll of some kind, where anonymity is vital.
