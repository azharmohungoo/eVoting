				The Deactivate Voter process will first retrieve the ID number from the request and validate if is a valid ID number, after which it will get all the necessary Voter details from the database which corresponds to that ID number. It then checks in what state the voter is to see if it has already been deactivated. If all cases are valid, then the voter's ActiveState will change from Valid to Invalid.

		Adding a new political party requires an active database connection, to be able if the party already exists and then once the data which must be persisted to the database is validated, the new party is added.

				\begin{itemize}
					\item If there is no connection to the database, the NoDatabaseConnection exception will be thrown.

		The addParty function will first check that a database connection exists and throw an appropriate exception otherwise. Once it has established a connection, it will then check to see if the new party the Admin wants to add does not already exist in the database. If the party already exists, an appropriate exception is thrown. If the party does not exist, the new party data is validated - with an exception being thrown if it is not valid, but if it is valid, then the new party data is successfully persisted to the database.
