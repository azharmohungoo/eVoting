\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Register}
	
	Registering a Voter collects all the data required for a user to be valid and adds that information to the Voter database. Once the Voter has been added to the database they will have access to a minimum system. The minimum system only allows them to log in and view where they can go to get activated (to allow access to the entire system) to allow them to participate in the current election.

			Register creates an initial state for a Voter and captures all the provided information in the database. Once information has been added to the database, the user can edit it themselves by accessing their account once they have logged in. Only valid data will be accepted. 
				\newline				
				
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Pre-conditions
					\begin{itemize}
						\item There must be a connection to the database
						\item The information provided by the user must be valid.
						\item The user must not exist in the current database. 
					\end{itemize}
					
					\item Exceptions
					\begin{itemize}
						\item If there is no connection to the database, the NoDatabaseConnection exception will be thrown.
						\item If the data is invalid then the service is refused and the InvalidData exception is thrown.
						\item If the user already exists in the database then the service is refused and the UserAlreadyExists exception is thrown.
					\end{itemize}
					
					\item Post-conditions
					\begin{itemize}
						\item The new Voter can log in and access the Electronic Voting system. 
						\item The Voter’s information is persisted to the database.
					\end{itemize}

				\begin{enumerate}
					\item The registerRequest object encapsulates all the necessary information required to add a new Voter to the system. 
					\item All the information collected by the register function is persisted to the database through the Database module's addVoter function.

				\end{figure}
				
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item The Register function first checks to see if there is a connection to the database, if there is not or the connection times out, the NoDatabaseConnection exception is thrown. 
					\item If there is a database connection, it checks whether the Voter's data is valid(according to the data types specified in the database). 
					\item If the data is not valid, the InvalidData exception is thrown. 
					\item Then the function checks whether the Voter's information already exists in the database and throws the VoterAlreadyExists exception if the Voter already exists.
					\item Otherwise no exception is thrown and the Voter's information is persisted to the database using the Database module's addVoter function. 
					
				\end{enumerate}
				
				
\end{enumerate}
	
	\item \textbf{Login}
	
	Login functionality gives the user access to system and allows them to view their account information, and only once they have been activated, are they allowed to cast votes and view other relevant information.

				\item Then it calls the Database module's validateUser function which will return an object that contains a boolean value of whether the voter is valid (and can thus access the system) as well as a reason or false (thus the Voter is denied access) as well as reason as to why the service has been denied.
