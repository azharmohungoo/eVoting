	\section{General Information}
	\subsection{System Overview}
	Electronic Voting, or eVoting for short, is a system which does exactly what the name suggest. It allows members of a demographic country to vote for a political party during an election period. It does so that each vote is completely anonymous by using Blockchain technology.\newline\newline
	The system is usable via an online web page and an Android(4.4+) application.\newline\newline
	There are essentially 4 types of users: An Administrator, a Political Party, an Activator and a Voter. Each having their own dedicated functionality. An administrator user can add a political party user, add an activator user, and deactivate a voter account. A political party account can only check the number of votes they currently have. An activator can only activate a user. And a voter can cast votes.\newline\newline
	In order to make Electronic Voting safe and trustworthy, the activator user is needed. Initially when a new user is registered, they will automatically be 'deactivated', which prevents them from casting any type of vote. This is to prevent a voter from creating a bunch of fake accounts and using those fake accounts to vote multiple times. An activator first need to verify the identity of a voter by providing proof of identity (a drivers license or ID document), after which a voter is then activated and will be granted 2 votes: one vote for a national party, and one vote for a provintial party.\newline\newline
	If a user has not registered yet, they can do so on the web site or on the Android application. Apon registration, the user need to provide: a valid ID number, a password used to log into the system, a name, a surname, the location their registered in (pre defined list of values eg. Pretoria, Johannesburg etc), a mobile number and an email address. A voter is the only user type that can register itself, an activator, political party and administrator can only be added by an existing administrator.\newline\newline
	The beautifull part of eVoting is that it uses Blockchain technology, the same technology used in the famous Bitcoin currency. A blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of records called blocks secured from tampering and revision. A more indepth description is beyond the scope of this document.
